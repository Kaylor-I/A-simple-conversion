# A-simple-conversion
A simple peoject to familary with functions about c++

Develop a function void manyPound2Kg(double poundData[], double kgData[],
int size). This function uses the function pound2Kg(...) to convert each value
in the array poundData to a kg value and stores the result into the array kgData.
The parameter size holds the number of elements in the arrays poundData,
kgData (remember that arrays in C donâ€™t know their size themselves) - it is
assumed that both arrays have the same size.
